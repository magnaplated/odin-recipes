# odin-recipes

This project was created to test rudimentary knowledge of HTML.

It includes regular usage of the most popular html commands, including boilerplate, headings of various sizes, paragraphs, images with alt text and custom sizes, and lists, both ordered and unordered.

This project also demonstrates competency with linking between pages. The files are organized appropriately to ensure effective collaboration.
